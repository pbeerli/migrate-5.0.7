Migrate version 4.5

This directory contains a few examples and some timings using
different compiled versions of migrate 4.5

infile.ep        Allozyme dataset with output outfile_allozyme.txt and outfile_allozyme.pdf   
infile.gap       Data set using 5 indpendent sequence loci of a single population
infile.msat      Data set using 10 msat loci (this dataset was used in the speed tests below.
infile.seq       Sequence data with two indendent loci (using the old data organization,
                 but new syntax)
twoswisstowns    Mixture of new and old syntax first old-style locus uses two different
                 mutation models for two partitions, second oldstyle locus is treated as
                 two partitions, 5 individuals are not assigned to a particular population,
                 and their assignment wil be estimated (this may lead to an underestimate
                 of the migration rates)
