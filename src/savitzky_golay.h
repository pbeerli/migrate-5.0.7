 smoothing routines

 The Savitzky-Golay smoother implementation used the resources of
 a pascal code Peter A. Gorry: 
 General least-squares smoothing and differentiation by the convolution (Savitzky-Golay) method.
 Analytical Chemistry 1990, 62, 6, 570â€“573
 and its extension by the machine learning java script repo: 
 https://github.com/mljs/savitzky-golay-generalized

 PB translated the Pascal code and and the JS code to python (see savitzky_golay.py) and that to C.
